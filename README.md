# Curve Beautification Project

## Mission
Our mission is to identify, regularize, and beautify curves in 2D Euclidean space. We start with closed curves and progressively work with more complex shapes. This project also covers symmetry and curve completion techniques.

## Introduction
The Curve Beautification Project aims to enhance and process 2D curves by implementing algorithms for curve identification, regularization, and beautification. We will focus on closed curves initially and expand to handle more intricate shapes. Additionally, we will explore techniques for symmetry detection and curve completion.

## Features
- **Curve Identification:** Detect and classify curves in 2D Euclidean space.
- **Regularization:** Smooth and adjust curves to ensure consistency and uniformity.
- **Beautification:** Enhance curves for aesthetic appeal and practical use.
- **Symmetry Analysis:** Identify and leverage symmetry in curves.
- **Curve Completion:** Fill in missing parts or extend curves to complete shapes.
